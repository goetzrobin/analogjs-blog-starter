Are you tired of boring old templates that just sit there, looking pretty but doing nothing? Say hello to structural
directives, the invisible superheroes of the Angular framework! These little guys may not have capes or masks, but they
pack a punch when it comes to adding dynamic behavior to your templates.

## What Are Structural Directives?

Structural directives are denoted by an asterisk (*) and alter the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements.
They're like little construction workers that build or tear down parts of your template based on the conditions you set.
Some examples of structural directives include `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and `*ngSwitch`.

## How Do They Work?

Structural directives work their magic by manipulating the template and adding or removing elements from the DOM. For
example, if you have a list of items that you only want to display if a certain condition is met, you can use
the `*ngIf` directive to only add the list to the DOM if that condition is true. This saves you from having to write
complex conditionals in your component class and keeps your template clean and concise.

## Why Are They Awesome?

Structural directives are awesome because they help keep your templates declarative and easy to read. Instead of writing
a bunch of conditionals or looping logic in your template, you can use a structural directive to handle it all for you.
Plus, they're super easy to use and make your templates look like a work of art.

## Conclusion

So the next time you're working on a template and feeling like it's missing something, consider adding a structural
directive or two. These invisible superheroes will add some dynamic behavior and make your template truly shine. Happy
coding!
